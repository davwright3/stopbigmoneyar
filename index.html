        This movement started on <strong>June 7th, 2025</strong>, when State Committee Members (SCMs) of the Arizona Democratic
        Party (ADP) voted overwhelmingly to establish a "People’s Primary" — a bold move to stop billionaires and corporations from buying our
        primary elections.
      </p>
      <p>
        On <strong>June 28th, 2025</strong>, the North Carolina Democratic Party joined the Arizona Democratic Party in
        committing to establishing a "People's Primary."
      </p>
      <p>
        On <strong>August 12th, 2025,</strong> DNC Chair <a
          href=https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/politics/dnc-chair-resolution-restrict-corporate-dark-money>Ken Martin
          announced</a> that he is going to offer this same resolution to the Democratic National Committee.
      </p>
      <p>On <strong>August 16th, 2025,</strong> the Democratic Party of Arkansas voted to table this resolution until the
        December 2025 State Committee Meeting. Now we're fighting to get the word out and ensure that we don't miss the
        opportunity to lead the nation in taking a stand against the oligarchs who have bought our democracy.
      </p>

        Want your state to be next?  <a href="mailto:stopbigmoneyar@gmail.com">Contact us</a> to learn how to propose this resolution in your state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We need your help.</strong> The State Committee Members, who will vote on our final policy in December are elected by
        members of our county. If we want to build a Democratic Party of Arkansas that stands up for the working class and
        stands against billionares and corporate influence, we need to recruit working class County Party Members who won't
        hesitate to advance the agenda of the 99% from inside the party.

    <h2>Our Resolution</h2>
    <h4><strong>Title: </strong>Resolution to Establish a "People's Primary" Policy Banning Billionaires and Corporations from Buying or Unduly Influencing Democratic Primaries</h4>
    <p>Democratic Party of Arkansas<br>
      State Committee<br>
      December 2025 Meeting<br>
      <strong>By: </strong> State Committee Member Hon. Corey Spangler<br>
      <strong>Date Submitted: </strong>August 16, 2025</p>
    
    <p><strong>WHEREAS, </strong>the Democratic Party is the party of the working class and Americans who believe in a one
      person, one vote democracy where our elections are determined by We the People as equal citizens -- not by billlionaires
      and big corporations; and</p>
    
      <p><strong>WHEREAS, </strong>working class voters should have no doubt that the candidates chosen in our primaries are
      not beholden to the same billionares and corporations that are exploting and hurting them; and</p>
    
      <p><strong>WHEREAS, </strong>the Democratic Party of Arkansas (DPA), as a voluntary association, has the authority and
      responsibility to regulate its internal affairs, including nominating processes and primary elections, to ensure
      fairness, integrity and alignment with our values; and</p>
    
      <p><strong>WHEREAS, </strong>to strenthen our party's brand, win back trust from many voters, and empower our party to
      win elections and govern to deliver for the working class, the DPA must act to confront the crisis of big money
      corrupting our democracy within the arena under our direct authority: our primary elections;</p>
    
      <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED </strong>that the DPA will establish a "People's Primary" policy to bar, to
      the greatest extent possible, the use of massive private wealth to buy or unduly influence our primary elections. This
      policy will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that candidates in Democratic primaries are not benefitted by,
      dependent on, or elected due to outside or independent electioneering spending funded by big donors who are
      circumventing legal limits on direct contributions to a candidate's campaign fund to spend tens or hundreds of
      thousands and even millions of dollars of private wealth to elect the candidates of their choice.</p>

    <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED </strong>that the Chair of the DPA shall form an ad-hoc committee to develop this
      policy that includes the organizers of this resolution and one mutually agreed upon member of the DPA Executive
      Committee. The committee will be charged with developing this policy to achieve the purpose established here-in and
      with formulating official propsed DPA People's Primary policy and procedures, including any bylaws changes, if
      necessary, to implement and enforce it. This policy and associated procedures, and any additional supporting
      resolution or bylaws changes, will be prepared and submitted for a vote at Quarter 2 2026 State Committee meeting.</p>
